##  What is meant by “Degrees of Freedom (DOF)”?
**Degree of Freedom (DOF)** refers to the number of independent movements a robotic arm can perform.  
The image below shows different types of motion involved in a 5-DOF robotic arm:

These include:
- **Revolve** – base rotation  
- **Forward and Backward** – linear segment motion  
- **Bend** – elbow-like joint movement  
- **Rotate** – twisting along the arm’s axis  
- **Swivel / Up and Down** – wrist-like adjustments


###  Joint Mechanisms
These motions are made possible using two main joint types:
- **Revolute Joint** – enables rotation around an axis  
- **Prismatic Joint** – enables linear sliding along an axis
